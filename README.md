Change is the law of life, and changes I have made. I'm a 9+ year veteran of the animal health care industry, turned software developer. 

Self-taught and specialized in Frontend languages, with almost 15 years of transferable experience in multiple industries, I'm working hard to become a well rounded Full-Stack developper.

My constant desire to find ways to improve systems and situations is what brought me to software development and as I begin my new career I am motivated by the idea of innovative growth and leaving things better than I found them.
