Change is the law of life, and changes I have made. I'm a 9+ year veteran of the animal health care industry turned software developer. Self-taught and specialized in Frontend languages (JavaScript, TypeScript, React etc), with almost 15 years of transferable experience in multiple industries.

My constant desire to find ways to improve systems and situations is what brought me to software development. I feel that being a part of the tech development world is the best way to impact industries in their search for advancement and can catapult businesses to becoming leaders in their fields. 

As I begin my new career I am motivated by the idea of innovative growth and continually working to improve things, leaving them better than they were.
