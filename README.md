Change is the law of life, and changes I have made. I'm a 9+ year veteran of the animal health care industry turned software developer. 

Self-taught and specialized in Frontend languages, with almost 15 years of transferable experience in multiple industries, I'm working hard to become a well rounded Full-Stack developper. <br/>
