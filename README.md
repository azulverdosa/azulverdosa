Change is the law of life, and changes I have made. I'm a 9+ year veteran of the animal health <br/>
care industry turned software developer. 

Self-taught and specialized in Frontend languages, with almost 15 years of transferable experience <br/>
in multiple industries, I'm working hard to become a well rounded Full-Stack developper. <br/>

My constant desire to find ways to improve systems and situations is what brought me to software <br/>
development and as I begin my new career I am motivated by the idea of innovative growth and <br/>
continually working to improve things, leaving them better than they were.<br/>
