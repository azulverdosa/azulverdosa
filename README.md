Change is the law of life, and changes I have made. I'm a 9+ year veteran of the animal health care industry turned software developer. 

Self-taught and specialized in Frontend languages, with almost 15 years of transferable experience in multiple industries, I'm working hard to become a well rounded Full-Stack developper. 

My current tech stack:
- HTML5
- CSS
- JavScript
- TypeScript
- React
- Node.js
- Express.js
- SQL
- Mongoose

Next on my list to learn:
- Python
- AWS
- Next.js
- Tailwind
- Java

My constant desire to find ways to improve systems and situations is what brought me to software development and as I begin my new career I am motivated by the idea of innovative growth and continually working to improve things, leaving them better than they were.
